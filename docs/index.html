    <h1>Privacy Policy for Tab Master</h1>
    <p>Last updated: May 31, 2024</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Tab Master Chrome Extension. Tab Master is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle and protect your data while you use our extension. Tab Master allows you to manage your browser tabs more efficiently without compromising your privacy.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Tab Master does not collect or store any personal data. The extension operates entirely within your local browser environment. Here is how we interact with your browser:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Browser Tabs:</strong> We access the titles, URLs, and favicon URLs of your open tabs to enable you to search, manage, and interact with these tabs directly through the extension. This data is not stored or transmitted outside your device; it is used in real-time and only retained during the active session.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tab Management:</strong> To provide functionalities such as searching tabs based on titles or URLs, displaying tab information, and allowing you to close or mute tabs directly from the extension.</li>
        <li><strong>User Interaction:</strong> To allow for direct interaction with the tabs via our extension interface, including focusing a tab, muting audio, and closing tabs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Protection</h2>
    <p>All data processing and management occurs within your local device. No information is transmitted externally or stored on any servers. We do not share or sell any data to third parties.</p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>You have full control over the extension and can disable or remove it at any time from your Chrome browser. Doing so will stop all interactions between the extension and your browser tabs.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
